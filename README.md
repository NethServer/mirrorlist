# mirrorlist

This is the list of official NethServer mirrors. 

If you think some mirror should be added/removed feel free to [edit the mirrors
file](https://github.com/NethServer/mirrorlist/edit/master/mirrors) and open a
pull request.

The `mirrors` file format follows these rules:

1. each line represents a mirror record
2. the line begins with the two letters country code where the mirror is 
   located, followed by a single space separator (e.g. `us `)
3. the line continues with the base mirror URL (e.g. `http://mirror.nethserver.org/nethserver/`)

## Mirror status

A `mirmon` report is available at http://mirror-status.nethserver.org/

## Donate a NethServer mirror

If you want to host a NethServer mirror 

* Read the community [HowTo](https://community.nethserver.org/t/how-to-create-your-own-nethserver-mirror/344)
* Edit [mirrors](https://github.com/NethServer/mirrorlist/edit/master/mirrors) and open a pull request

## Configuration

All the configuration is set by ``config.php``. Other scripts should not be
modified, unless a business rule change is wanted.

The mirrors list is generated by ``nethserver.php`` for both ns6 and ns7. The
``centos.php`` script is specific to ns6: it generates the mirrors list for
CentOS repositories, or it redirects to mirrorlist.centos.org.

Use cases and configuration rules:

- Edit ``$stable_releases`` only when NethServer releases a new version.
  The old stable number must go to ``$vault_releases`` (see next rule)

- Warning! If a release number is not listed neither in ``$vault_releases`` nor
  in ``$stable_releases``, the stable release number is returned, triggering a
  system upgrade if yum-cron runs

- When a CentOS stable release goes to vault, list that release number under
  ``$vault_releases``. It is allowed to list the same release number under both
  ``$stable_releases`` and ``$vault_releases``: the effect is that it is served
  by `mirror.nethserver.org` or `vault.centos.org`

- Wait the old stable CentOS is served by vault before releasing the new
  NethServer release
